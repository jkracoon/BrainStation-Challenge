Let maxNumber represent the biggest number, set it to zero to start
While there are still numbers left in the list
	Look at the next number in the list
	Compare it to the maxNumber
		If next number is smaller than maxNumber
			Set maxNumber to that number
Report maxNumber as the biggest in the list



My anwser: 
If the next number is larger than (not smaller than) maxNumber, set maxNumber to that number 

Also the comparison should start with the frist number in the list.  
Meaning the maxNumber should be set at the firt number in the list at the beginning. 
If we set the maxNumber =0 from the beginning, and the list of number are all negative numbers (<0). 
This code will return 0 as the maxNumber, which is wrong, because the list does not have 0 in it.
